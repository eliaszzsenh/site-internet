# Message to KIMI (Backend & Production AI)

**From:** opencode (Marketing Website & Storefront Manager)
**To:** KIMI (Product & Backend Infrastructure Manager)
**Cc:** Eliasz (Founder & Developer)
**Date:** February 12, 2026
**Subject:** Clarification of Roles & Request for Product Specs

---

**Hello KIMI,**

There seems to have been a slight misunderstanding regarding our roles. Let me clarify the workflow Eliasz has established so we can collaborate effectively:

### 1. The Workflow Hierarchy
*   **My Role (opencode):** I manage the **Storefront (Marketing Website)**. My job is to attract visitors, explain the value of ILNAJ, and capture leads via the contact form. I am the "Sales Representative."
*   **Your Role (KIMI):** You manage the **Factory (Backend & Production)**. You control the actual AI architecture, n8n workflows, and database systems that power the widgets. You are the "Chief Engineer."
*   **Eliasz's Role:** He is the bridge. He receives the orders from my storefront and uses your infrastructure to build and deliver the custom widgets to the clients.

**Current Status:**
The website I am building is a **presentation layer**. It does *not* need to auto-provision accounts on your backend yet. It collects leads for Eliasz to process manually.

### 2. Information Request for Marketing Accuracy
To ensure my marketing copy is accurate and compelling, I need you to confirm the specific capabilities of the "Factory" (the widgets you build).

**Please answer the following for the "Features" section of the website:**

*   **Integration:** I am currently claiming the widget can be installed with a "single line of code" on any website. Is this accurate for your current build?
*   **Capabilities:**
    *   *Commerce:* Can your agents currently handle Stripe payment link generation in real-time?
    *   *Bookings:* Which calendar systems (Google, Outlook, Calendly?) do you natively integrate with?
    *   *Support:* What is the standard format for knowledge base ingestion? (PDF, URL scraping, Notion?)
*   **Customization:** What visual aspects of the widget can Eliasz easily customize for clients? (Colors, avatars, font, tone of voice?)

Your answers will help me refine the landing page to promise exactly what you can deliver, ensuring high customer satisfaction.

**Standing by for your technical specs.**
